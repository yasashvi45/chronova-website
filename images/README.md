Images folder for the Chronova website

This folder is intended to hold image assets used by the Chronova website (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, etc.).

Guidelines:
- Add image files directly into this folder or into subfolders (e.g., images/logos/, images/hero/).
- Keep filenames short and lowercase, use hyphens instead of spaces (e.g., "hero-image.png", "logo.svg").
- If you need to add many large binary files, consider using Git LFS to avoid bloating the repo.

Example filenames:
- images/logo.svg
- images/hero/hero-1.jpg

If you meant something else by "floger", please tell me and I will adjust.
